# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

- This repo is a blueprint for a one-page Next.js site. The main specification lives in `PROJECT_GUIDE.md` at the root.
- When the app is scaffolded (see guide), keep the structure close to:
  - `src/app/` (or `app/`): routing, `layout.tsx`, `page.tsx`.
  - `src/components/`: `layout/`, `sections/`, and `ui/` (shadcn).
  - `src/lib/`: shared utilities and `data.ts` for content.
  - `src/styles/`: global styles (e.g., `globals.css`).

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- Install dependencies once the Next.js app is created:
  - `npm install`
- Run the dev server (default at `http://localhost:3000`):
  - `npm run dev`
- Create a production build:
  - `npm run build`
- Lint the codebase:
  - `npm run lint`
- Testing is not configured yet; add a script (for example `npm test`) before documenting it here.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

- Use TypeScript, React function components, and 2-space indentation.
- Components: `PascalCase` (`Hero.tsx`, `Pricing.tsx`); variables, hooks, and helpers: `camelCase`.
- Keep files small and section-focused; prefer `components/sections/Hero.tsx` over large monolithic pages.
- Use ESLint and Prettier with the defaults generated by `create-next-app`; fix all lints before opening a PR.
- Keep Tailwind classes ordered logically (layout → spacing → color → state).

## Testing Guidelines

- No test framework is defined yet. When adding one, prefer a lightweight setup (e.g., Vitest or Jest + Testing Library for React components).
- Co-locate tests with source files using `.test.ts(x)` suffix (for example `Hero.test.tsx`).
- Aim for meaningful coverage on core sections (layout, navigation, pricing logic) rather than 100% line coverage.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

- Write commits in imperative mood and keep them focused, for example: `Add pricing section layout` or `Fix navbar scroll behavior`.
- Reference related issues in the description (`Closes #123`) and summarize user-visible changes.
- For UI changes, include before/after screenshots or short GIFs when possible.
- Keep PRs small, self-contained, and aligned with the structure and principles in `PROJECT_GUIDE.md`.

## Agent-Specific Instructions

- Follow this document for any automated edits and keep changes minimal and reversible.
- Do not introduce new tools or frameworks beyond what `PROJECT_GUIDE.md` describes without clear justification.
- When updating project structure or conventions, revise this `AGENTS.md` and the guide together to stay in sync.
